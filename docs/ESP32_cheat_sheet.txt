See notes below.

If using the board for the first time, it is recommended to erase the flash::

	esptool.py --chip esp32c3 --port /dev/ttyUSB0 erase_flash

Flash Micropython:

	esptool.py --port /dev/ttyACM0 write_flash -z 0x0 ESP32_GENERIC_C3-20240602-v1.23.0.bin

We are currently using: ``ESP32_GENERIC_C3-20240602-v1.23.0.bin``

Older version that worked: 

- ``esp32c3-usb-20220618-v1.19.1.bin``



Notes:

	- There does not seem to be a distinction anymore between the USB and non-USB version.
	- 2024-09-16: Tried the C3 Mini micropython firmware (LOLIN_C3_MINI-20240602-v1.23.0.bin) as the hardware also has a direct USB connection, but the EEMON42 display would stay blank even if micropython was running. Maybe 
rshell
