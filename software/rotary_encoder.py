class RotaryEncoder():
    """ Creates a rotary encoder decoding object connected to `pin_a` and `pin_b` and sets the interrupt on these pins
    to continuously keep track of the encoder movements.

    The rotary encoder sequence for the two encoder pins is 11, 01, 00, 10, 11 for clockwise rotation, 
    and the sequence is in the opposite direction for counterclockwise rotation.
    The detent (stable state) is on 11.

    The encoder position is stored in `self._value` and is accessed with `self.value()`. 

    The decoding is performed by the Pin interrupt handler `process_state()` which should be called when the state of
    either of the encoder pin changes.

    Principle of operation: each each time we call `process_state()`, we increment the `sub_incr` counter by the direction of
    movement (+1, -1) obtained from the previous and current encoder state. If the current encoder lands in its detent
    position ('11'), we add `sub_incr//4` to the counter, i.e. it will add +1 or -1 only if we have detected +4 or -4
    subincrements since the last detent landing.

    Invalid transition (skipping 2 encoder phases states) are problematic as we can't tell which direction we went. We
    try to salvage some of those those events and increase our accuracy by keeping track of these missed counts and
    adding later with the direction of the other valid increments. We don't use the missed counts if increment count is
    null. Of course this won't help if we miss too many states between `process_state()` calls.

    Parameters:

        pin_a, pin_b (machine.Pin): Pins connected to the rotary encoder.
            These pins must already have been configured properly.

        irq_wrapper (fn): If specified, wraps the Pin interrupt handler that tracks
            encoder movements. 

        verbose (int): verbose level for testing
